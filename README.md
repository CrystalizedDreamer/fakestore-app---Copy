# FakeStoreApp
I was finally able to figure out how to commit to github directly from my laptop. REJOICE

Alright, enough of that.

This project was assigned by my friends and mentors at Coding temple
This represents my work bringing together REACT Bootstrap, and API integrations. 

I have only a few thoughts: I do not care much for Bootstrap (for aesthetic reasons, not for functionality reasons
I lovvveee React, it is so much faster and more flexible than my time making static websites

I decided to practice separating out my components into different modules in order to promote better readability
